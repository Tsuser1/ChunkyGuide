### Scene

{% responsive_image path: "assets/images/user_interface/chunky_render_scene.png" %}

`Open scene directory` - Opens current scene's directory on disk.

`Export settings` - Allows you to export scene settings on a per section basis.

`x0.5`, `x1.5`, `x2` - Modifies the canvas size by the amount. ie Wx0.5,Hx0.5

`Load players`

`Enable biome colors`

`Save dump once every` - Recommended to save often as to not loose any progress on renders if the worst occurs. But not too often as this process does take time.

`Save snapshot for each dump`

`Y min clip` - Default 0; Setting this will cut off blocks below which can speed up renders.

`Y max clip` - Default 256; Setting this will cut off blocks above which can speed up renders.

`Enable sunlight` - Toggles whether or not sunlight should be traced.

`Draw sun` - Hides the sun texture in the sky.

### Sky & Fog

{% responsive_image path: "assets/images/user_interface/chunky_render_skyfog.png" %}

`Sky mode` - Simulated, Solid Color, Color Gradient, Skymap (panoramic), Skymap (spherical), Skybox, Black

`Sky mode settings`

	`Simulated` - A simple day-light sky model (Preetham Sky)
	
	- Horizon offset - 0.1
	
	`Solid Color` - Paints a solid color sky.
	
	- RGB picker
	
	`Color Gradient` - Smooth blended gradient between two or more colors.
	
	{% responsive_image path: "assets/images/user_interface/chunky_render_skyfog_grad.png" %}
	
	`Skymap (panoramic)` - Panoramic sky textures either taken in real life or generated by other applications can be used.
	
	- `Load skymap` - Opens a file picker
	
	- `Vertical resolution` - Half (mirrored) ie 360x90 or Full 360x180
	
	- `Skymap rotation` - Rotates the skymap horizontally.
	
	`Skymap (spherical)` - These aren't that common.. I'm not sure.
	
	- `Load skymap` - Opens a file picker

	- `Skymap rotation` - Rotates the skymap horizontally.
	
	`Skybox` - Load upto 6 textures which get mapped onto a cuboid to act as a sky. [More information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skybox_(video_games))
	
	- `Up`, `Down`, `Front`, `Back`, `Left`, `Right` - Opens a file picker
	
	- `Skymap rotation` - Rotates the skybox horizontally.

	`Black` - Not sure why we have this option given we have a `Solid Color` option.

`Transparent sky` - Makes the sky transparent.

`Enable clouds` - Toggles simple clouds on and off.

`Cloud size` - Controls the scaling of the clouds (it's a simple "3D" texture so it'll change position).

`Cloud X` - Shifts clouds along X axis.

`Cloud Y` - Shifts clouds along Y axis.

`Cloud Z`- Shifts clouds along Z axis

`Fog density` - Logarithmic scaled Fog density. The default of 0 is off. Scales between 0.001 and 1.0. Depending on scene composition the impact Fog density can have is variable. You may need to manually enter values into the text field to access densities between 0.0 - 0.001 and 1.0+.

`Sky fog blending` - Controls the amount that Fog will bleed into the sky. This is not impacted by `Fog density` and can be used to help avoid masking a `Sky Texture` while still blending.

`Fog color` - RGB picker.

### Water

{% responsive_image path: "assets/images/user_interface/chunky_render_water.png" %}

`Still water` - Disables wavy water normals.
