## Installing Plugins

Upon opening the `Plugin Manager` within the `Chunky Launcher` a `Plugins` folder will be created in the install directory. Chunky plugins, which are `.jar` files, should be placed in the `Plugins` folder and then enabled within the `Plugin Manager`.

For a list of available plugins, please see the [Pluings page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/userinterface/plugins.html).
