<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>

<div align="center">
I have been using Chunky for well over 6 years by this point. Over the years I have learnt so much and I feel it's time to put everything in writing. This guide is my 6 years of knowledge combined with developments and ideas from within the community since it's inception.
