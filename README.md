## jackjt8's Guide to Chunky 

Welcome to my guide to Chunky.

### About me

I have been using Chunky for well over 6 years by this point. Over the years I have learnt so much and I feel it's time to put everything in writing. This guide is my 6 years of knowledge combined with developments and ideas from within the community since it's inception.

Just in case anyone wants to see my work, you can find all of it in this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_SPuj2L5KJSSmpwOVlFWlJtWE0?usp=sharing)
